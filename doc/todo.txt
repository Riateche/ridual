Actions when there is an error while executing a task:
- if predefined action was "cancel", cancel task and show a message
- if predefined action was "ask":
  Create new window and ask OS to pay attention on it. Show information about bad file,
  destination (if any), buttons for possible actions (don't forget "retry" action for
  all cases), total count of errors in the task.
  If all files are iterated and there are pending question(s), task becomes suspended.
  Task also pauses if maximum length of bad files list (50,000) is reached.
- else perform predefined action and continue.

All options in the dialog must be remembered. Their values must be default on next dialog
showing.

If some files was skipped or overwritten without propmt, the dialog about this must
appear after the task is completed.

At the bottom of main window the tasks table must be displayed. Columns:
- Current action:
  - "Copying <relative_filename>". May be also "Moving", "Creating link to" etc.
  - "Reading files list". Appears on recursive looking at the start of task or in main loop.
  (Files tree mustn't be saved on recursive looking because it can be rather big.)
  - "Waiting in queue"
  - "Waiting for your answer"
- Current progress: progress bar for copying current file (if any)
- Total progress: progress bar for the whole task (if available)
- Errors count: count of files skipped and waiting for user's answer. After giving an answer
  this number must decrease.

Context menu of table row:
- Pause/Resume
- Abort
- Settings: show settings dialog. Settings dialog is the same is creation dialog. Name of
  action (copy, move etc), all source files and destination dir (if any) must be displayed
  in description field (in html for beautiful output). Queue can't be changed after creating
  a task.
