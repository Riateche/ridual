- rename:
  - rename using fields other that file_name
  - prevent opening item when ending file name editing with Enter
  - select file name or base name in open editor (configurable)


- bugs:
  - if cursor is not at selection item, ignore selection
  - single mouse click shouldn't select clicked item, only set cursor position
  - left/right buttons should set cursor to other columns
  - space causes toggling selection incorrectly if only one cell is selected instead of the whole row
  - merge folder while copying: strange error messages
  - hotkeys on non-english encoding in address field
  - unchecking path button should not be possible

- top priority:
  - folder context menu: open in system FM, open in terminal
  - access to current directory's context menu
  - open in other program typed by user
  - ask question "delete incomplete file?" after interrupting a task or skipping a file
  - auto answering system
    - when user changes task settings, it must affect current question (if any)
    - popup dialog for editing task auto-answering settings:
      - Apply new settings to: (checkboxes)
      * this task
      * all created tasks
      * new tasks in the future
    - if the rule is enabled for new tasks, warning should be displayed
      at main window until this rule is removed (like "task will be placed in queue")
    - If some files was skipped or overwritten without propmt, the message about this must
    appear after the task is completed
  - select destination after copying; select created folder; etc.
  - F2 - rename
  - sound on messages
  - display tasks waiting in queue
  - button to hide a warning
  - show/hide hidden files

- important:
  - display free space on current volume
  - check for free space before operations
  - fast filter file list by typing mask
  - tabs
  - only one copy per user
  - system integration: show folder, show file
  - navigation history; hotkeys; quick search in history
  - back/forward
  - unmount, eject, safely remove
  - drag and drop
    - from ridual to other programs or itself
    - to pane
    - to folder in pane
    - url to address field

- bonuses:
  - clipboard - copy real file paths, copy URIs
  - embedded terminal (open in tab in the other panel)
  - pause and abort every task with keyboard


- perspective:
  - uri completion:
    - place popup in appropriate X position
    - don't show popup when there is only one suggestion and it's the same as address text
    - suggestion for "places" children (?)
  - gio monitoring for trash:///
  - fallback theme for file icons
  - if trying to execute not-executable, prompt to make file executable
  - run-time permission granting
  - undo
  - file search
  - display count of selected items, total space used by them
  - select all, unselect all, invert selection, select/unselect by regexp
  - extract archive to destination, extract here, browse into archive
  - set max copy speed
  - auto max speed tool based on destination and source folder
  - drag and drop
  - mass rename tool (F2 for many files)
  - create link dialog:
    - hard link
    - absolute soft link
    - relative soft link
  - gvfs mount with password and other questions
  - predefined templates for new file based on specified filename for creation (regexp match)
    (for example: *.py - create file with python header, *.cpp - create hello world)
  - Shift+F5, Shift+F6 - modify paths before copying
  - Option to stop currently running recursive fetch
  - edit bookmarks
  - warning about too many (>3) queues
  - Option "Follow symlinks"
  - hotkeys for 2nd, 3rd associated apps
  - unix drives list
  - separate tab for all (current and pending) tasks; long description of each task here


- ideas:
  - if average size of file is small, display total progress based on files count
  instead of size

- other features:
  - ability to select view and open commands from gio apps list
  - progress in unity taskbar
  - copy selected files names to clipboard (only filename, full path, full network path)
  - icons for "places" menus
  - paste data from clipboard to file (text, html etc)
  - auto numbering when pasting from clipboard to the same directory
